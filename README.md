Only a life lived for others is worth living.‚Äù

Our objective is to build a portal that can act as a platform to serve the society. In this project, we are making an attempt to connect people who are willing to be part of social initiatives like blood donation, hair donation, volunteering social awareness campaigns and so on. For example, logged in users can search for blood donors within the portal which will be notified to them. The portal also provides the users an opportunity to publish fund-raising programmes and details of people and organisations seeking help, once the admin verifies its authenticity.

This is achieved through the maintenance of a database containing the details of users including blood group, questionnaire regarding their willingness to participate for the notified events, contact details etc. Our project is expected to have a very user-friendly interface. We are utilizing powerful database management, data retrieval and data manipulation to implement our objective.
